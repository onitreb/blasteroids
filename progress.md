Original prompt: Build an Asteroids-like 2D web game where the ship attracts small asteroids into a magnet/forcefield radius, they stick to the ship (snowball), and the player can burst them outward; ejected small asteroids break large asteroids into small pieces; small-vs-small annihilates.

Notes
- Keep a single canvas, expose `window.render_game_to_text()` and a deterministic `window.advanceTime(ms)` for Playwright.
- Controls target: rotate + thrust like classic Asteroids; burst on Space or left mouse.

TODO
- Add game over / restart UX polish.
- Tune magnet strength and burst speed.
- Add simple sound effects (optional).

Updates
- Implemented a first playable version (ship movement, magnet ring, attachment, burst, splitting + annihilation, basic HUD, fullscreen toggle).
- Switched to a single non-module JS file so the game can be opened via `file://` (the sandbox disallows binding a local dev server port).
- Playwright validation is currently blocked in this sandbox because the `playwright` npm package can’t be installed (no network) and isn’t preinstalled.
- Added 3 asteroid sizes (small/med/large), 25% more starting asteroids, elastic-ish collisions, and a velocity-gated fracture rule (fast burst-thrown smalls can fracture med/large and get consumed).
- Small asteroids now stick to the surface of the forcefield ring (half the attraction radius), and the larger attraction circle is a debug toggle in the menu (default on). Ship collision behavior (explode vs bounce) is also a menu toggle.
- Updated attraction to a gravity-well model (stronger when closer), increased attraction radius +5%, increased burst speed +5%, and added simple KISS explosion visuals on burst + collisions. Burst-thrown smalls now self-destruct on impact; they fracture large→2 med and med→2 small (when fast enough).
- Removed the “time window” for fast small impacts: whether a small self-destructs / fractures now depends on current impact speed (velocity-based), and smalls attach to the inner forcefield ring (not the outer attraction radius).
- Clarified visuals + tuning: outer dashed blue ring = gravity radius (debug), inner yellow ring = forcefield surface that smalls stick to; added menu sliders (gravity/burst/capture/damage/fracture) and made ring “capture” forces fade out for high-speed smalls so bursts actually fling outward.
- Added gem drops + scoring: every broken small asteroid spawns a gem (emerald/ruby/diamond at 50%/40%/10%), gems glow and get pulled in/absorbed by the ship for points; score also shown in an HTML HUD overlay.
- Added per-slider “Set default” persistence for tuning via localStorage and added plain-English descriptions under each tuning slider.
- Tweaked gem sizes (green baseline; red ~15% larger; blue ~30% larger) and increased gravity inside the forcefield ring (50% stronger) with extra damping to reduce “slip by” captures.
- Added a debug tuning slider for ship thrust.
- Added a debug tuning slider for inner ring gravity multiplier (how much stronger gravity becomes once inside the forcefield ring).
- Added gem expiration: gems now expire after a tunable lifetime (default 6s) and strobe faster and faster before disappearing (Gem lifetime slider).
- Updated gem expiry visuals: gems now *blink* (no gradual fade) with faster strobing near expiry.
- Tuned gem blinking: no blinking for first half of gem life, then a smooth ramp up to a tunable max blink rate (Gem blink max slider, default 5/s).
- Refactored gem blinking (KISS): blinking now uses an accumulated phase updated in `updateGems` so frequency ramps feel steady (no irregular flicker from time-based modulo with changing frequency).
- Added an occasional blue flying saucer enemy: it spawns offscreen from any edge, glides across without wrapping, fires 2 yellow laser shots toward the ship, and despawns once it exits the playfield.
- Updated saucer behavior pass: doubled saucer size, switched firing to continuous random burst cycles (1-2 shots per burst with ~1-3s pauses), made lasers despawn at the exact canvas edge, and added gentle swerving/lazy flight instead of a rigid straight path.
- Fixed saucer laser visibility regression: beam alpha was tied to removed `ttlSec`, causing effectively invisible shots; refactored to a stable bright yellow beam with stronger core + additive outer glow and verified in-browser screenshot/state.
- Added saucer destruction behavior: asteroid impact destroys saucer, plays yellow explosion/ring FX, removes saucer, awards score, and drops a large yellow/gold gem.
- Refactored gem expiry visuals from hard blink-off to continuous throbbing (bright↔dim) so gems never fully disappear before expiry.
- Strengthened gem pickup feel: larger gem attraction radius, stronger gem gravity + ring capture/funneling, higher in-ring pull, and larger collection radius; gold gem TTL increased to keep it collectible.
- Tightened saucer kill rule: saucer now only dies to ship-launched asteroids (rocks ejected from the player burst), not ambient field rocks.
- Refactored gem gravity/capture math to match the small-asteroid model exactly (same attract radius, gravity, ring capture, radial damping, and inner-ring damping) to remove lurchy behavior.
- Reduced saucer gold-drop size (smaller base radius and lower drop jitter) while keeping the same yellow/gold identity.
- Simplified gem pull again per feedback: gems now ignore shield/ring capture logic entirely and are continuously accelerated directly toward ship center with stronger close-range pull (smooth inverse-square + soft core boost), so they no longer stall at forcefield radius.
- Began large-arena enhancement track: added `state.world` and `state.camera` scaffolding in `src/main.js` (plus `syncCameraToShip()`), with world intentionally still coupled to viewport in this step to avoid gameplay/render behavior changes. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` passes; Playwright client remains blocked because `playwright` package is not installed in this sandbox.
- Large-arena LA-02 pass: removed viewport wrapping (`wrapPos`) and added world-bound helpers (`confineShipToWorld`, `confineBodyToWorld`). Ship now clamps/stops at world edge; asteroids and gems now bounce off world edges with damping; saucer/laser bounds now use `state.world`. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` passes. Per user request, browser run is paused until explicitly resumed.
- Large-arena LA-03/LA-04 pass: render pipeline now applies camera offset (`ctx.translate(w/2 - camera.x, h/2 - camera.y)`), and centered camera mode is active via `syncCameraToShip()` each update. Also updated `render_game_to_text` metadata to include `world` and `camera` fields plus corrected coordinate-system description. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` passes; browser run still paused per user request.
- Large-arena LA-05..LA-09 pass: implemented dead-zone camera logic (`camera.mode === "deadzone"`), camera world-clamping, first-pass arena boundary line render, world-aware spawn/despawn bounds, and timed off-screen asteroid replenishment with a dynamic min/target/max population budget (scaled by world/view area and capped by `maxAsteroids`). Validation: `node --check src/main.js` passes; browser run still paused per user request.
- Browser smoke run resumed and completed (DevTools): start/menu flow works, controls respond, ship correctly clamps at world edge, and console shows no errors. Current default camera mode remains `centered`; dead-zone mode exists in code but is not wired to UI/toggle yet.
- Arena behavior update (small step): removed asteroid/gem boundary bounce behavior and switched both to out-of-bounds despawn (`isOutsideWorld(...)`), matching intended design direction. Ship boundary clamp remains unchanged.
- Next small implementation slice: added in-menu arena controls for camera mode (`centered` / `deadzone`) and world size scale (`1x..4x`), with new game-side config hooks (`setArenaConfig`, `applyWorldScale`) so panning can be tested without extra refactors. Kept this step browser-free per user request; validation via `node --check src/main.js`.
- Browser validation of new arena controls (DevTools): selecting `Dead-zone pan` and setting arena scale to `2.00x` updates runtime state (`camera.mode=deadzone`, `world` dimensions doubled). Deterministic movement test confirmed dead-zone behavior (small move keeps camera fixed, longer move causes pan). Switching back to `centered` made camera lock to ship center when not clamped at world edge. Console remained clean.
- LA-10 incremental implementation (terminal-only): added lightweight world cell bookkeeping (`worldCells.sizePx`, `asteroidCounts`, `activeKeys`) rebuilt each tick and used during ambient asteroid spawn to avoid inactive cells and over-dense cells (`cellCount >= 10`). Also exposed cell index stats in `render_game_to_text` under `world_cells`.
- LA-11 incremental implementation (terminal-only): replaced asteroid-vs-asteroid all-pairs loop with a spatial-hash broadphase helper (`forEachNearbyAsteroidPair`) using nearby-cell candidate iteration. Collision resolution logic itself remains the same; only candidate generation changed. Validation: `node --check src/main.js`.
- Browser validation pass for LA-10/LA-11 (DevTools): with `Dead-zone pan` + `2.00x` arena, deterministic movement and long simulation produced no console errors. `render_game_to_text.world_cells` remained consistent (`active_count`/indexed cells nonzero and stable), spawn maintenance continued filling the arena, and collision/burst interactions still behaved correctly (counts and score changed plausibly).
- Added adjustable 3-layer parallax starfield background so movement is readable: new tuning sliders `Star density` and `Parallax strength` (with Set default persistence), background layer rebuild hook, and camera-relative parallax render pass. Added `background` telemetry in `render_game_to_text` (`star_density`, `parallax_strength`, layer count). Browser-validated with low/high parallax screenshots and no console errors.
- Added subtle star accents + twinkle pass: stars now support rare accent colors (gold/red/blue), optional per-star twinkle modulation (alpha + slight radius), and new tuning sliders/default persistence for `Accent star chance`, `Twinkle star chance`, `Twinkle strength`, and `Twinkle speed`. Extended `render_game_to_text.background` telemetry with these values. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` passed. Browser smoke intentionally not run in this step.
- Visual readability follow-up: asteroids are now filled black (opaque interior) so background stars no longer show through rock silhouettes. Twinkle visibility adjusted upward (higher default twinkle chance/strength/speed and stronger modulation range), and twinkle now animates in the menu too (was previously tied to gameplay time only). Validation: `node --check src/main.js` + browser smoke pass (menu + gameplay) with no game-console errors.
- Default tuning/menu tweak: reduced `Twinkle star chance` by 50% (0.36 → 0.18), set default camera mode to `deadzone`, and set default world scale to `3.00x` (menu + runtime defaults aligned). Validation: `node --check src/main.js` + browser reload check of menu values and `render_game_to_text`.
- Arena scale range update: world scale slider now supports up to `10.00x` (was `4.00x`), and arena scale clamping was expanded to `1..10` in runtime config. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` + browser check at `10x` in menu and gameplay (`world` telemetry reached 19600x13050 with no console errors).
- Global spawn authority pass (design-oriented): asteroid replenishment now spawns globally across arena cells (no camera-side spawn bias), startup now bulk-fills toward world-scale target density, and game start guarantees local on-screen asteroid presence (`counts.asteroids_on_screen` telemetry added). Validation at `10x`: immediate gameplay had ~1094 asteroids total, `asteroids_on_screen=13`, and ~915 indexed asteroid cells with no console errors.
- Added debug slider for global spawn density (`Global asteroid density`) wired to `asteroidWorldDensityScale` with live output + Set default persistence. Validation: `node --check src/main.js` plus browser sanity check confirmed min/max/step (`0.08..1.5`, `0.02`) and runtime effect after start.
- Density + spawn-visibility follow-up: increased high-end arena capacity (`maxAsteroids=4000`) and expanded global density slider range to `0.08..2.5`. Runtime replenishment now excludes active camera view when spawning so asteroids do not pop into visible space. Validation at `10x`, density `2.5`: startup had ~2400 asteroids with ~27 on-screen; after simulation total continued climbing (>3000) while on-screen count changed gradually (no pop-in jumps) and console stayed clean.
- Added a new resumable implementation tracker for ship progression and size scaling: `ship-growth-progression-plan.md` (ship tiers at 500/1000 gem points, expanded asteroid sizes, tiered forcefields, in-game debug menu toggle/reorg, and growth-triggered camera zoom plan). This was a planning-only step; no gameplay code changed yet.
- Implemented the ship-growth feature slice in `src/main.js` + `index.html`:
  - Added data-driven ship tiers (`small`, `medium`, `large`) with distinct shapes/engine layouts and size scaling (`1x`, `2x`, `4x`).
  - Added asteroid sizes `xlarge` + `xxlarge`, generalized size fracture graph (`size -> next smaller`), and XL/XXL spawn/radius tuning controls.
  - Added progression unlocks by gem score (`500` / `1000` defaults), tier override controls, and a live gem-score debug slider.
  - Generalized forcefield/attraction to tier rules (small-only, small+med, small+med+large) and tier-scaled radii/colors.
  - Added growth-driven camera zoom state with tweened transitions and debug controls for per-tier zoom targets + duration.
  - Added in-game debug menu open/close while playing (`M` / backquote / top-right button), pause-on-open behavior, apply+resume flow, and grouped 2-column debug/tuning layout.
  - Added runtime ship renderer swap API for future SVG assets: `window.set_ship_svg_renderer(tierKey, svgPathData, scale)`.
- Telemetry updates:
  - `render_game_to_text` now includes progression/tier/zoom metadata and expanded asteroid size counts.
- Validation:
  - `node --check src/main.js` passes.
  - Playwright client remains unavailable in this environment (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: playwright`), so browser validation was done via DevTools:
    - Verified debug menu opens/closes in active gameplay via button and `KeyM`.
    - Verified pause-on-open toggle (`pausedDelta=0`, `unpausedDelta>0`).
    - Verified tier transitions + zoom tween using gem-score debug slider (`small 1.00 -> medium 0.78 -> large 0.58`).
    - Verified XL/XXL asteroids present in runtime state and no console errors.
